# What is a playbook, in general?

# A Playbook

---

# What are Ansible Playbooks?

Playbooks are YAML files with ordered lists of tasks, so you can run them in that order repeatedly.

---

# Your First Playbook

---

# Your First Playbook (`playbook.yml`)

```yaml
- name: My first Playbook
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Echo "Success" in a file
      shell:
        echo "Success!" >> /root/alright.txt
```

---

# Execute your first Playbook

```console
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbooks.yml
```

---

# Execute your first Playbook

```console
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbooks.yml

PLAY [My first Playbook] **********************************************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ************************************************************************************************************
ok: [managed-node-01]

TASK [Echo "Success" in a file] ***************************************************************************************************
changed: [managed-node-01]

PLAY RECAP ************************************************************************************************************************
managed-node-01            : ok=2    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
```

---

# Let's see some examples

---

# Let's install Python 3 on our remote system

---

# `pb-python3.yml`

```yml
- name: Install Python 3
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Run apt-get update and install Python 3
      apt:
        name: python3
        update_cache: yes
```

---

# Install Python 3

```console
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml pb-python3.yml
```

---

# Let's install pip as well

---

# `pb-python3.yml`

```yml
- name: Install Python 3 and pip
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Run apt-get update and install Python 3
      apt:
        name: python3
        update_cache: yes
    - name: Install pip
      apt:
        name: python3-pip
```

---

# Install Python 3 and pip

```console
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml pb-python3.yml
```

---

# Let's create symbolic links

We would want to use `python` and `pip`, instead of `python3` and `pip3` respectively.

- `/usr/bin/python` ‚Üí `/usr/bin/python3`
- `/usr/bin/pip` ‚Üí `/usr/bin/pip3`

---

# `pb-python3.yml`

```yml
- name: Install Python 3 and pip
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Run apt-get update and install Python 3
      apt:
        name: python3
        update_cache: yes
    - name: Install pip
      apt:
        name: python3-pip
    - name: Create symlink for python executable
      file:
        src: /usr/bin/python3
        dest: /usr/bin/python
        state: link
    - name: Create symlink for pip executable
      file:
        src: /usr/bin/pip3
        dest: /usr/bin/pip
        state: link
```

---

# Install Python 3 and pip and create symbolic links

```console
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml pb-python3.yml
```

---

# Install Python 3 and pip and create symbolic links

```console
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml pb-python3.yml

# ... truncated output

managed-node-01            : ok=5    changed=2  # ...truncated output
```

---

# Let's run this again

```console
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml pb-python3.yml
```

---

# Let's run this again

```console
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml pb-python3.yml

# ... truncated output

managed-node-01            : ok=5    changed=0  # ...truncated output
```

---

# Roles

---

# Roles

Roles are ways of automatically loading certain vars_files (?), tasks, and handlers (?) based on a known file structure.

Grouping content by roles also allows easy sharing (?) of roles with other users.

---

# Too many unknown words.

---

# Roles (in my own words)

Roles are re-usable automation packages for Ansible.

---

# Let's use our first Role

---

# Let's use our first Role

```console
ansible-galaxy install nginxinc.nginx
```

---

# Wow! Hold up.

---

# Wow! Hold up.

What is `ansible-galaxy`?

This can also be used a `ansible-galaxy install`

# Ansible Playbooks with Roles

---

# Now, let's do use our first Role

```console
ansible-galaxy install nginxinc.nginx
```

---

# `nginx.yml`

```yaml
- name: Install NGINX
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - nginxinc.nginx
```

---

# Install NGINX

```console
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml nginx.yml
```

---

# How do I learn more about the `nginxinc.nginx` Ansible Role?

---

# How do I learn more about the `nginxinc.nginx` Ansible Role?

https://galaxy.ansible.com/nginxinc/nginx

---

# What if I want to tailored behavior?

---

# Enter variables

---

# Ansible Variables

Ansible lets us use variables to tailor Inventories, Roles and Playbooks according to our needs.

We will focus on Playbook variables.

---

# Variable names

Variable names should be letters, numbers, and underscores. Variables should always start with a letter.

- **üëç Fine:** `foo_port`, `foo5`
- **üëé Not Fine:** `foo-port`, `foo port`, `foo.port`, `12`

---

# `redis.yml`

```yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - davidwittman.redis
  vars:
    redis_version: 5.0.9
```

---

# Install Redis 5.0.9

```console
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml redis.yml
```

---

# Now let's combine everything in one Playbook

---

# `main.yml`

```yaml
- name: Setup system with Python, NGINX and Redis
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Run apt-get update and install Python 3
      apt:
        name: python3
        update_cache: yes
    - name: Install pip
      apt:
        name: python3-pip
    - name: Create symlink for python executable
      file:
        src: /usr/bin/python3
        dest: /usr/bin/python
        state: link
    - name: Create symlink for pip executable
      file:
        src: /usr/bin/pip3
        dest: /usr/bin/pip
        state: link
  roles:
    - nginxinc.nginx
