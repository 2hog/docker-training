# Docker training by 2hog

This repo contains the different trainings help by 2hog on Docker. This README should help you navigate through the material and find the needed resources.

This repo shall be kept private, while other resources - like presentations and code examples - can be made available publicly in different mediums, aka other repos and/or deployed online.

## Trainings list

* [Introduction to Docker and Containers - half day](intro-docker-containers)
* [Introduction to Orchestration and Continuous Integration with Docker Swarm - half day](intro-swarm-ci-cd)

## Modules

* Introduction to Docker and containers [4h]  
  Docker and containers have drastically changed the way we develop and deploy applications. This module aims at introducing participants to the world of containers through Docker, showcasing the pros, cons and common best practices.
  
  * What is a container?
  * Introduction to the Docker platform
  * Understanding Docker images and Dockerfiles
  * Volumes
  * Networking
  * Docker Compose

* Introduction to container orchestration with Docker Swarm [4h]  
  Docker and containers have drastically changed the way we develop and deploy applications. After mastering containers, it's only natural to start deploying containers in production. This module aims at introducing participants to orchestrator principles through Docker Swarm, showcasing the different concepts, pros, cons and common best practices.
  
  * Container orchestration
  * Topology and concepts
  * Underlay and overlay networking
  * Docker Swarm
  * Deployments
  * Container deployment principles

* Container orchestration with Docker Swarm: from theory to practice [4h]  
  Docker and containers have drastically changed the way we develop and deploy applications. Deploying an orchestrator is being easier as the days go by, but what happens after the cluster is ready? This module aims at introducing participants to orchestrator principles through Docker Swarm, showcasing the different concepts, pros, cons and common best practices.
  * Container orchestration concepts in action
  * Docker Swarm management
  * Docker Compose as a deployment format
  * Monitoring
  * Debugging

* CI/CD in the container world, with Docker [4h]  
  Continuously integrating and deploying your applications and services is crucial to the success and speed of your development team. With containers, this has been made really easy, as deployment processes that took hours, can be now made within minutes. There are different challenges though and a need for a change in mindset.
  * Concepts of CI system (can be based on Drone CI or Gitlab CI)
  * Understanding the need for dev-prod parity
  * Using Docker Compose from development to production
  * Using Docker Compose in a CI system
  * Creating effective and fast builds with Docker
