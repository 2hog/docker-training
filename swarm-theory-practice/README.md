# Docker Swarm: from theory to practice

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce students to the world of orchestration, through Docker Swarm. It contains the basic concepts, best practices and shows the way to go to production with confidence.

Docker and containers have drastically changed the way we develop and deploy applications. After mastering containers, it's only natural to start deploying containers in production. This module aims at introducing participants to orchestrator principles through Docker Swarm, showcasing the different concepts, pros, cons and common best practices, while showing the way to go to production with confidence.
